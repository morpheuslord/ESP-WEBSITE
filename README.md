# ESP-WEBSITE
My simple IoT project on coding a web page into my ESP-WROOM-32 Micro Processor.

# things to note
**web username and password**
***********************************
**USERNAME: server**
**PASSWORD: password**
***********************************
**wifi connectivity**
to access the server you need to connect the ESP32 to your system you need to 
connect to your home wifi and you are good to go.

# what we can see via this project
we can see that the codes written in html need not be in a format therefore we can stack different codes upon each others
making the code super compact.
and the modules being inside the print function we cannot implement a file read option and the which support such implementation wont work good with the server and AP connection
therefore we need to seperate the codes into section and then implement them including the CSS part and not having js implemented in it we can use online codes to implement advanced animations into our simple webpage.
